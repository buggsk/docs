Orchestro provides two different environments for its participants. 
 
- Production 
- Stage/Sandbox 
 
Carrier Participants should use the stage environment as a playground to test the features before switching over to the production environment. 
 
The table below gives a quick reference to the endpoint addresses. Reach out to Orchestro (carrier.integration@orchestro.ai) integration team for access tokens.
