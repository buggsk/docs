## Shippers
### Direct Shipper/Brand 

Orchestro is an open national carrier network (OCN) which provides a single point of access to all the carriers and their coverage. A brand or shipper can inject parcels into the OCN as a national carrier for delivery.

### Carrier

The Orchestro network allows any carrier to expand their delivery coverage to a national footprint. This capability could be used to increase the offering for existing customer relationships or provide an entry point to new opportunities.

## Delivery Agent

Carriers can choose to be the destination carrier last mile delivery agents for receiving volume from the network.

## Middle Mile
Carriers/Brands can participate in doing the line haul to inject into another carrier network. This is only applicable if the participant is of type shipper or a pure middle mile provider.

## Carrier Participant in Multiple Roles 

A participant may choose to function as a shipper/origin carrier, delivery agent and a middle mile. This requires a bi-directional data flow and integration. Orchestro strongly encourages participants to create this integration since it provides access to all network capabilities. 
 
The image below illustrates the data exchanged between Orchestro and the bi-directional participant.
