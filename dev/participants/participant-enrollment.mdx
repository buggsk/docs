The Carrier Participant enrollment to the Orchestro Network is a four-step process.

## Contract

A contract must be in place before a carrier can be active on the network. Data points like rates, coverage, zones, and service level commitments could be deliverable to the technical teams from the sales contract. Integration can begin with step **02** onboarding once an NDA is in place but is not considered complete until a contract is executed. 
 
## Onboard
Orchestro will share the onboarding template to its participant, to capture the carrier network configurations, preferences, data exchange preferences, etc. The data is then mapped to the network. In the future, the entire onboarding process will be self-serve on the portal.  
 
## Integration
Orchestro will assign a technical team to assist the participant with integrating per the Network standards. A channel of communication will be established for the carrier administrator to connect with the Orchestro integration team.  We will provide a sandbox environment for initial integration and testing. Production credentials are provided once the carrier is ready for live transactions.  
 
## View
All participants are provided access to their Orchestro Network configuration and order data through a portal view. Initial access is for the Carrier Participant administrator. Additional role-based access is assigned by the assigned administrator. The portal also provides actionable metrics, analytics, and insights of the participantâ€™s performance.
