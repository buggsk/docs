title: 'Label Specification'
description: 'This section details the Orchestro standard label design format and specifications for its use.'
---


## Standard Label Use 

All parcels sent to the Orchestro platform must use this standard label for proper routing and rating. Labels are available through the Orchestro platform. 


## Standard Label Certification 
Carrier Partners, calling the API and generating labels must submit test samples to the Orchestro label team for certification prior to physical parcel shipping. This is to ensure proper implementation of the standard label format.  
 
Please submit samples to carrier.integration@orchestro.ai with Label Certification in the subject line. Carrier’s integration team can also assist in the certification process.  


##  Standard Label Design

The Orchestro standard label is designed to ensure interoperability across the network. Barcodes and tracking IDs are required to be recognized and understood by all participating carriers. 
 
This label features a GS1-128 1D barcode for the Orchestro universal tracking ID, along with a 2D data matrix barcode that encodes specific details about the parcel. The label is designed to accommodate a default routing as well as a dynamic routing using an embedded URL to optimize parcel movement even after label is printed and parcel is in transit.

## Unified Label Use
This is an integrated label that adds an Orchestro tracking ID and barcode to the existing carrier label specifications, positioning it as an addendum at the bottom. This approach ensures minimal disruption to the carriers' current label formats. 

## Unified Label Design 

The proposed unified label will comprise three sections: 
 
- **Section 1 - Human readable:**  This section will contain the **FROM** and **TO** addresses in plain English along with any additional details in accordance with the current carrier label specifications. 
 
- **Section 2 – Carrier IDs:** This section will contain tracking information (including IDs and barcodes of the carrier) in accordance with the current carrier label specifications.  
 
- **Section 3 – Orchestro:** This section contains Orchestro generated tracking IDs and barcodes. 

<Note> Orchestro will call carrier’s ‘Create Shipment’ API to get Sections 1 and 2. </Note> 
 
The design of the label is as below:
