SFTP enables the exchange of manifest data in both directions using CSV files. Orchestro can typically accommodate and handle files in the preferred format of the carrier. Orchestro recommends using the universal manifest file format. To obtain a sample of the latest manifest version in CSV format, carriers should please contact Orchestro (carrier.integration@orchestro.ai.) 
 
Carriers acting as shippers should log in and upload files to the IN directory. Destination carriers will find incoming manifest files for download in the OUT directory. SFTP folders should be requested by contacting Orchestro (carrier.integration@orchestro.ai). 
 
Carriers wishing to use their own manifest file format must provide Orchestro with a sample. Samples should be sent to carrier.integration@orchestro.ai. Orchestro can configure the necessary mappings.
