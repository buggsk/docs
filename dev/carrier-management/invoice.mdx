Orchestro receives invoices from participants who provide services to shippers on behalf of Orchestro. Currently invoices are ingested through a SFTP setup, using a standard flat file format.  
 
<Note>Carriers are required to provide parcel level invoices in the Orchestro standard invoice csv format. A sample should be provided during integration.  </Note>
 
Orchestro does not support any EDI ingestion at present.  
 
The frequency of invoicing for the participants is determined during the contract negotiation. For the services rendered, Orchestro provides its shippers with invoices in a uniform manner. Participant Carriers can send the bills via email or SFTP flat file.
