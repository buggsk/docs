The Orchestro network offers analytics and intelligence to Carier Participants on all their contacted parcels.   Performance metrics for understanding profitability by zip, forecasting of network volume for the participants facilities, labor planning, route planning, actionable operational performance and improve door-step aggregation.  
 
Orchestro also synthesizes and creates awareness at the network level.  Since it is a network of networks, we aggregate data across all Participant Carriers to benefit all parties. 

Example: Fraud, doorstep properties like dog, pin to the door, consignee preferences. These insights will be provided wherever appropriate as part of the transaction or portal.  

Some Participant Carriers have partnered with Orchestro to strengthen the power of analytics even further. Those carriers are providing Orchestro with an anonymized feed of all package level event data flowing through the carrier network. This data is used to understand and forecast the package demand in a specific region.  Two types of data are ingested for analytics: 
- Package information (origin/destination) 
- Scan events.  

To participate in this program, simply notify Orchestro during integration or any time after. We will provide carrier specific endpoints for analytics integration. Carriers should publish all tracking events for analytics in the standard event format to the analytics-event webhook endpoint. All package information will be published to the analytics-package webhook endpoint in the standard manifest format.
