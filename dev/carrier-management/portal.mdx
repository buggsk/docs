Orchestro provides all network participants authenticated access to the portal. The application is provisioned during the integration phase. An administrator account is created, and credentials are provided. Additional role-based users should be created by the carrier administrator.  
 
Carrier Participants can view and edit their network configurations and preferences using the portal. The portal also provides the participants with basic metrics and forecasts for their operational planning. These accounts are provisioned by either federated access or user profile creation based on the participant preference.
